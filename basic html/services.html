              EIFS, when installed properly is an economical system that
              provides: <br /><br />
              - Energy efficiency
              <br /><br />
              - Stabilization of temperature of the structure <br /><br />
              - Aesthetic flexibility EIFS has had problems in the past from low
              quality installations causing leakage. The improper sealing of
              openings and lack of proper expansion joints are two primary
              causes of problems resulting in water intrusion. When properly
              installed these problems have been eliminated. The best way to
              ensure a proper installation is inspecting as the installation is
              in progress. Once installed and in service, an inspection can
              identify problems and early solutions can be implemented, thus
              reducing the need for expensive repairs. EEI's EIFS Certified
              Inspector Neil Otto has been certified by the Exterior Design
              Institute.

              Radon Gas is in virtually all homes in the St. Louis area. The gas
              originates in the earth and travels in the soil and into our
              homes. Homes with a basement, basement or foundation cracking,
              crawlspace or sump pump systems are more likely to have increased
              Radon gas levels. The size and age of your home has nothing to do
              with your level of risk. Twenty (20%) percent of the homes in the
              St. Louis area have dangerous levels of Radon gas present. If you
              are a smoker and you live with elevated levels of Radon gas, your
              chance of developing Lung Cancer increase exponentially. The EPA
              considers Radon gas to be a serious indoor environmental threat,
              second only to smoking as a cause of lung cancer related deaths. A
              Harvard University study found Radon gas to be 400 times more
              deadly than asbestos.
              <br />
              <br />
              Awareness is the most important step in solving a Radon problem.
              By testing you learn about your chance of getting Radon induced
              lung cancer while living in your home. The next step is to consult
              with a qualified expert to choose which remedial steps may be
              necessary to reduce your risk of lung cancer.
              <br />
              <br />
              The law has required all schools and libraries to test for Radon
              gas exposure. The next step for all business and residential
              property owners is to test for this deadly gas. Testing is
              mandatory for residential purchase in many states and all
              relocation companies require testing. Don't wait for the slow
              process of the law to catch this deadly problem. Your school
              district does not allow this problem and neither should you. Act
              now to protect your family.

              We perform hundreds of roof investigations each year. There is not
              a type of roof that we haven't seen. Damon Sagehorn is a Haag
              Certified Residential and Commercial Inspector. He has been
              performing roof evaluations for over twenty (20) years. Here are
              some of the roof types that we regularly inspect:
              <br /><br />
              - Composite or asphalt and fiberglass shingles <br />
              - Cedar shake and cedar shingle <br />
              - Slate <br />
              - Built up roof (BUR) <br />
              - Bitumen and modified bitumen <br />
              - Ethylene Propylene Diene and Erpolymer (EPDM) <br />
              - Thermoplastic Olefin (TPO) <br />
              - PVC <br />
              - Metal roofing <br />
              <br />

              Investigations range from determining a reason for leaks to roof
              damage from weather events. If you are looking for what is really
              wrong with your roof, we can tell you.

              EEI performs inspections on HVAC systems. We will typically test
              all units to ensure proper functionality and that hazards do not
              exist. Any flues or lines visible will be inspected for any
              potential problems. EEI checks cooling and heating air duct
              temperatures to ensure the cooling coil is not clogged and that
              the heat exchanger is working correctly. The temperature controls
              will be cycled through the heating and air conditioning to ensure
              the units are not short cycling. The controls are checked to make
              sure they reach their set points. Hydronic and steam systems are
              checked for proper boiler, chiller and valve operation. Also, the
              Variable Air Volume, Fan Coil and Damper operations are checked to
              ensure proper functionality.

              We have electrical engineers on staff that can diagnose both
              hardware and software problems. Often times problems develop due
              to brown outs or power surges making digital controls unstable.
              EEI has evaluated damage as the result of lightning, locating the
              point where lightning has entered and exited a structure to
              determine what was damaged and what needs to be replaced.
              <br />
              National Electrical code, NFPA 70 evaluations. The electrical
              panels will have covers removed and all screw connections checked.
              The wire sizes and circuit breakers or fuses will be checked to
              ensure they match. The GFCI receptacles and two or three prong
              receptacles will be tested. All open wiring will be checked for
              proper securing and all switches and lighting will be tested for
              proper operation. Electrical equipment such as water heater,
              range, or oven will be tested for proper operation without
              tripping circuit breakers or fuses. The branch circuits will be
              tested for voltage drop. In essence, all non-concealed electrical
              wiring will be tested.

              Temperature Control Systems evaluations. EEI is experienced in the
              design of DDC controls, hydronic heating and cooling, boilers,
              chillers, air handlers, dampers, pneumatics, actuators and
              communications.

              Computer/Microprocessor Systems evaluations. EEI is experienced
              with interface and control logic. Experienced with operating
              parameters from system level down to the component.
              <br /><br />
              Electro Mechanical Systems evaluations. When systems are not
              functioning normally our objective approach to the problem
              isolates functions. Is the problem electrical, mechanical or
              interface related. Each are isolated checked and the cause
              determined.
              <br /><br />
              Water Damage Determination. Water and electronics do not mix, so
              what is the result of water and electronics, is it damaged, can it
              be cleaned, can it be fixed or should it be replaced. These are
              the basic questions EEI works on in evaluating water damage. EEI
              has established procedures that get to the result fast.

              EEI has thermo imaging capabilities, enabling us to analyze
              temperature dependent problems such as temperature loss or gain
              situations. Infrared camera imaging enables us to see the world in
              terms of temperature and then relate the temperature to what is
              happening in the environment. Once we know what is happening then
              we can determine what plan of action needs to be taken to correct
              the situation. EEI can even determine equipment or components that
              are failing before they actually fail. The equipment can be
              identified when it is over stressed and determine the source of
              the stress.

              Home Inspections
              <br /><br />
              A professional home inspection is a very important part in the
              process of purchasing a home. It helps the buyer make a sound
              purchasing decision. A qualified person should complete the home
              inspection to inform you if there is anything wrong with the
              property and if so, how to correct those problems. A regular home
              inspector cannot give counsel on structural problems and will have
              to refer you to a licensed engineering firm. We are a licensed
              engineering firm and we will save our clients double fees. Damon
              Sagehorn is a certified ASHI inspector for over 15 years. He and
              Neil Otto are both certified Code Inspectors through the
              International Code Council (ICC).
              <br /><br />
              IMPORTANANCE OF ASHI MEMBERSHIP The American Society of Home
              Inspectors (ASHI) is the oldest and largest association of
              professional home inspectors in the United States. Its objectives
              are to promote excellence within the profession and continual
              improvement of the members inspection services. As consumers you
              need to know there is no state licensing for home inspectors in
              the state of Missouri. This means anyone can call himself or
              herself a home inspector without the proper training, education,
              or experience. ASHI inspectors follow strict Standards of Practice
              and Code of Ethics to ensure the most professional inspection
              available to you anywhere.
              <br /><br />
              What kind of information can you expect from a professional home
              inspection? Our inspections include the following areas: ground
              drainage, exterior, roofing system, interiors, electrical,
              heating, air conditioning and plumbing systems, garages, patios,
              and porches. Consumers should not expect their reports to include
              the condition of every nail, wire, or pipe in the home. However,
              major visible deficiencies and/or safety related concerns should
              be in the report along with what needs to be done to correct the
              deficiencies.
              <br /><br />
              We request the buyer to be present during the inspection and ask
              questions. We are there to be helpful and provide as much
              information as possible during our qualified engineering
              inspection. We will issue a written report based on the
              inspector's findings. This report is written in paragraph form
              with photographs and is very easy to understand. However, if you
              need assistance we encourage follow-up phone calls.
              <br /><br />
              A professional home inspection may save the buyer money. Most
              times the inspection report enables the buyer to negotiate with
              the owner of the property to have the deficiencies corrected or
              reduce the price of the home.

              that when the structures are used in normal every day situations
              the occupants are safe. A typical inspection will check outlets
              for grounding, GFCI outlets operate correctly, electrical panel is
              proper, plumbing leaks, toilet operation, bath functionality,
              heating and ventilation is proper, smoke detectors functional,
              emergency egress is proper, fire separation in place, automatic
              door safety operations, trip hazards, etc.
              <br /><br />
              Municipalities commonly have their own pre-printed inspection
              procedure or form the inspector will use. If not we can develop
              one to meet your communities needs. Only certified code inspectors
              will perform your inspections and turn in the report within twenty
              (20) minutes to your office.

              Architect, Engineers and Owners as the project develops so the
              intent of all are understood. EEI can provide direction to the
              contractors leaving time to address problems that require more
              extensive study (i.e. Excavating has encountered rock, what are
              the alternatives and how to proceed.)
              <br /><br />
              Once a project is underway, scheduling is the most critical job
              function. Scheduling is coordinated using computer automated
              software that allows us to understand impacts to the schedule real
              time. Thus rescheduling can be done quickly and accurately. EEI
              also develops three week schedules allowing contractors to
              concentrate on the relevant conditions. The disciplines can see
              what is coming up and be prepared to meet the events.
              <br /><br />
              Construction logs and photographic progress are maintained

              EEI designs what the owner wants. It is YOUR building.
              <br /><br />
              Our forensic experience of over 30,000 building damage
              investigations tells us what to avoid so we can design a 100-year
              life expectancy building with normal maintenance to fulfill your
              needs, budget and wants.
              <br /><br />
              Our designs are cost effective allowing the owner to receive more
              building for their money than any other company we know.
              <br /><br />
              We handle all aspects of the design with the owner involved as
              much or as little as they choose. The owner is able to get a fast
              response to questions or problems.
              <br /><br />
              We provide 3-dimensional (3D) modeling allowing the owner to
              visually see what the building and lot will look like from any
              angle selected prior to the development of drawings. This allows
              changes to a design before the details are started. This also
              reduces the chance of design changes, speeding up design time and
              keeping the project cost at a minimal.
